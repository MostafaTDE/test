                    <h2>What is global warming?</h2>
                    <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change."</p>

                <h4>melting ice glaciers</h4>
                <p>When warm summer air melts the surface of a glacier, the meltwater bores holes down through the ice. It makes its way all the way down to the bottom of the glacier where it runs between the ice and the glacier bed, and eventually shoots out in a plume at the glacier base and into the surrounding ocean.</p>

                <h4>rising sea levels</h4>
                <p>Sea level rise refers to the average increase in the water level of the Earth's oceans. Over the last century sea level has increased (and continues to rise) due to global warming caused by the human activities that have increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">What causes global warming</h1>
        <p>Global warming is primarily caused by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in Earth's atmosphere, resulting from human activities. The most significant GHGs include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). CO2, the most prevalent, is released through the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy, transportation, and industrial processes. Deforestation also plays a major role, as trees naturally absorb CO2; when they are cut down or burned, not only is this carbon absorption lost, but the carbon stored in the trees is also released. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted from agricultural practices, especially livestock digestion (enteric fermentation) and the decay of organic waste in landfills. Industrial processes and the use of synthetic fertilizers contribute to nitrous oxide emissions. Furthermore, activities such as cement production and the extraction of oil and gas intensify the release of GHGs. As these gases accumulate in the atmosphere, they trap heat that would otherwise escape into space, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to rising global temperatures. Other factors, such as urbanization and land-use changes, contribute to the phenomenon by altering natural heat absorption and reflection. The increased global temperatures cause a cascade of environmental consequences, including more frequent and severe weather events, melting polar ice, rising sea levels, and shifts in ecosystems and wildlife. While natural processes like volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation can influence Earth's climate, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activities are the dominant force behind the current trend of global warming.</p>
